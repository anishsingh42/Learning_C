This is Lecture-6 of programming in ANSI C.
In this lecture we learned about operators,their predences and their associativity and have to solve the following questions use them.

Q1)Given three numbers,find the minimum among three numbers using ternary operators (ONLY).
Q2)Take an integer from user and display its each and every byte.
Q3)Take 4 integer ABCD and display ACBD.
Q4)Take 2 unsigned characters {
    A=0010 1011
    B=1100 1001
}  Interchange 1011 of A with 1100 of B.
Q5)Take a character input and then:
	i) Show its 4 left most bits and 4 right most bits
	ii) Interchange the left most bits with the right most bits and print.
